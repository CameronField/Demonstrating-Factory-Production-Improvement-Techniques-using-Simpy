# Demonstrating-Factory-Production-Improvement-Techniques-with-Simpy
Description: Discrete event simulation and analysis of a manufacturing plant using SimPy.

To get started, please open the file titled "Olympic_Production_Model.ipynb". All model outputs and analysis are within that notebook.

All original .py scripts of the simpy models are included in this repository as well if you would like to run the model yourself.
